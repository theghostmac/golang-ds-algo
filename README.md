# Data Structures and Algorithms in Golang

With this repository, I learn data structures and algorithms as required by job interviews.
There's a repo for data structures, and one for algorithms.
There's also a few [exercises](https://github.com/theghostmac/golang-ds-algo/exercises) - with solutions included.

## Installation
```shell
git clone (https://github.com/theghostmac/golang-ds-algo/)
```
**NB**
There will be a tests.yaml file after integration with GH Workflows.
